Doing the lab with will today was very helpful - he stepped me through the github processing, which was a huge help, and allowed me to clear up with my thoughts about github, and prep the question/presentation for the instructors on Wednesday.

I am not yet 100% on github - need to ask the instructors my question tomorrow.

Lab was ez-pz. Annoying CSS stuff.

Still need to get this canvas crap figured out, and need to get caught up.

I am fucking exhausted. Lecture and class time is putting me TF to sleep. I need these supplements to kick in asap, and ask about my stomach ffs.
