Okay, better.

Spoke with the instructors - my analysis of things was correct. "CF Notes For Instructors.txt" copied at end of this document.

Finishing up git crap - just got my logins done, set up a bunch of packages n' shit, also set up live-server with instructors' help.

Stomach supplements (para-disbyo-zyme) on the way, $$$ coming from Skills-Fund on Nov 1st.

----------------------------------------

Explain and understand github process

> Instructors are going to put each assignment as the mainline repository.
> At the beginning of each assignment, we fork those off (one copy if we're pair programming).
> A fork creates a 100% exact copy of the Instructors' mainline on the github servers under our control, AS OPPOSED TO the instructor's.
> We create our own branch on our fork, 1 per person for pair pogramming.
!!!! Why do we have to branch? Pair programming or otherwise, couldn't we just check back into our fork's "master"?
> We clone the repo to our local system, select our branch.
> We do work, add it to the changelist, and commit it to the branch.
> We, in the role of the 'Developer', submit a 'pull request' so that "The Team" (usually just us and our partner) can review the changes.
Then, we, alse in the role of the Master of our Forked Trunk, are then able to Accept our pull requests.

Okay - I got confused with the git process, becuase I only ever committed and pushed at scout -> Other people were responsible for the merging -> and I only ever checking into mainline when i did my entry project.

Here at CF, we're basically mimicking an ENTIRE organizational project.


Branches versus master:

Allie: Don't check into master - important for group. Merging becomes important. Wait for instruction on Project week.

Should be creating one banch.

Allie - Lab git: when you're making pull request, don't make it to CF ultra-master - make it to OUR forked trunk.



!!!! Someone claimed today that it's a good idea to branch every time you're about to do work - isn't this a duplication of git's capabilities? You should just be able to revert any given Branch to a Check-in, correct?




Live-server setup - my LiveServer is broken - I need someone to help me out.



Atom missing parsers? - People have been talking about atom requiring



Canvas vs github tutorial and questions:

I know we're probably not gonna change the procedure halfway through class, but why are we providing instructional material inside gitHub... inside the READMEs?
