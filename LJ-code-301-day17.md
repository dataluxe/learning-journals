<h1># LJ Code 301 - Day 17 (Final Project Week)</h1>

I really do NOT have time do be doing this.

What have I Learned:

> API munging is fun.

> Marvel puts limits on its API. This will necessitate our DB.

> Nobody takes the lead. Holy crap. Everyone ends ALL SENTENCES in a fucking question!!! Where have the men gone? I love my team, and all three of these guys have the potential to be very solid devs, but come ON!!!! I might say something today.

> We need to refactor our Front-End, AWAY from the demo code. The instructors built in a bunch of design choices.... the team does not yet think on the level of doing full refactorings.

> I really don't like software.

> I cannot live in a crappy house and be happy.

> I need to leave here AT 5PM EVERY DAY. Spending a while f*ing day indoors is bad enough.

> We need to rock today.
