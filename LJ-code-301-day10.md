I'm more on-top of it this week. Glad it's Friday. Wednesday was absolute fucking hell thanks to my late-night cleaning, and I am absolutely exhausted.

Definitely rediscovering some things about being in class - now that I'm lucid, I can actually put words to thoses vague thoughts I had earlier. Lot of very dim bulbs nowadays. Very sad. Gotta move past that. Do well on my stuff, get a solid job, blow on the coals, get it to an easily-maintained roar, and check out.

Have a huge backlog of shovelwork to finish this weekend. Very upset the CF does not seem to understand the existence of 'shovelwork'... do these people really not understand that this stuff gets in the way of actual learning?

VERY excited to be doing this networking stuff. Awesome to finally see a full-stack site from end-to end! Starting to 'feel like the real thing'.

NOT HAPPY (meh) about the prospect of being disappointed by CF's instruction on how to create a PROPER full-stack environment. I current expect to be dissappointed (bad habit), and I REAAAALLLY do not want to be dissappointed right now. Kava will help.
