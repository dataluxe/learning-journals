Lab 04 with Andrew was fine. Best yet, and the code was easy beans.

Andrew is a bit frosty - it may be similar to me - stressing until one finds the solution to a structural rats-nest in javascript.

I'm glad he dug into his reservations about the fact that Handlebars.compile was returning a function - I noticed that I had glossed over this way too fast (incorrectly installing the belief that Handlebars returned an object) and that I need to slow the fuck down a bit - I think that the way i get myself tied in knots if often due to this bad habit.

We muscled through the lab pretty quick - I was starting to go down a fairly deep rabbit hole (my other problem) about arrow functions, until Kat helped me pull out.
