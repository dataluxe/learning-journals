This week has gotten away from me - combination of back-work, preoccupation with after-school things, the damn cleaning, the mis-shipped supplements, and now lack of sleep has disrupted my flow badly. Gotta get back on it.

Once again, I am behind because I do not know how to set up my environment correctly.

Gotta get on top of this.
