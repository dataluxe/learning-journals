Lab 03 with Fred was a bit clusterfuckity.

I need to reel in my partner when they're being dumb - the most effective way to do so is 1) to be calm, 2) to communicate clearly and effectively (and gently if the parner is stressed out) 3) to offer an alternate, better solution to their current predicament, and 4) to not wait too long until doing so.

I touched base with Dustin:
- Lateness on assignments is not a big problem, just stay in touch with the instructors,
- There is never a late penalty for readings.
- I will catch up this weekend.

- Doing better on the git process.

Feeling all right.
