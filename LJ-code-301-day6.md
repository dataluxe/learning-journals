Very soothing lab today - absolutely easy, very satisfying, learned some new stuff.

Here comes the network stuff - I am afraid.

This undone shovelwork is really poisoning this beautiful day. Can't focus on lab anyways, but I especially can't focus if I have undone work..... btu i can't just zone out.
